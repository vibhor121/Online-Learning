# 🌤️ Cloudinary Setup Guide for EduLearn

## What is Cloudinary?
Cloudinary is a **FREE** cloud-based image and video management service that:
- 📁 **Stores images/videos** in the cloud (like Google Drive for media)
- ⚡ **Optimizes images** automatically for faster loading
- 🌍 **Global CDN** - images load fast worldwide
- 🆓 **25GB FREE** storage + 25GB monthly bandwidth
- 🔧 **Easy integration** with your web app
